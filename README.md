# Minesweeper RC (Remote Control)

An implementation of the classic Windows game Minesweeper that can be played either locally or via a Websocket JSON-based API. It has been primarily designed to be remotely controlled by Minesweeper solvers without the need for screen scraping or other UI detection mechanisms. It could also be used to actually play Minesweeper via a remote UI, but not sure why anyone would want to do that =)

Note that this is still in early development stage and is not yet functional. I will update this README when it is ready for use.
